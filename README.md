# GadgetJunkie MERN Stack eCommerce App

Welcome to the GadgetJunkie project! This is a full-fledged eCommerce shop built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js) along with Redux Toolkit for state management. We will start building this app from scratch, guiding you through setting up the server, modeling data, creating a MongoDB database, seeding data, creating the user interface, managing state with Redux, implementing authentication using JWT, integrating payment with PayPal, and much more. This site is live on https://gadgetjunkie.onrender.com and deployment is done with with the help of __render__.

   Make sure to set up the required environment variables for your backend and frontend.

3. **Set up the backend server using Node.js and MongoDB:**

   Set up your backend server using Node.js and MongoDB. Make sure you have the necessary configurations in place.

4. **Install frontend dependencies using npm:**

   ```
   cd frontend
   npm install
   ```

5. **Install backend dependencies:**

   ```
   npm install
   ```

## Folder Structure of the Project

The project's folder structure is organized as follows:

Project Root/
- GadgetJunkie/
  - backend/
    - controllers/
    - middlewares/
    - models/
    - routes/
    - utils/
  - frontend/
    - public/
    - src/
      - actions/
      - components/
      - constants/
      - reducers/
      - screens/
      - store/
  - package.json
  - README.md
  - .env



The `backend` directory contains server-related files, routes, models, middleware, and utility functions. The `frontend` directory contains the React frontend application with folders for actions, components, constants, reducers, screens, and the global store.

## Backend Setup

To set up the backend:

1. Install the necessary dependencies using npm:

```bash
cd backend
npm install
```
Create a .env file in the backend folder with the following environment variables:
dotenv
Copy code
PORT=5000
MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_uri_here
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_here
Replace your_mongodb_uri_here with your MongoDB connection string and your_jwt_secret_here with a secret key for JWT authentication.

Seed the initial data into the MongoDB database:

Copy code
```bash
npm run data:import
Start the backend server:
```
Copy code
```bash
npm start
```
The backend server will run on port 5000 by default. You can access the API endpoints at http://localhost:5000/api.

Frontend Setup
To set up the frontend:

Install the necessary dependencies using npm:
bash
Copy code
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```
Start the frontend development server:
bash
Copy code
```bash
npm start
```
The frontend development server will run on port 3000 by default. You can access the app at http://localhost:3000/.
